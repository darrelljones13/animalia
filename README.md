## Purpose

TreeFrog is an educational and exploratory tool that portrays the vastness of the animal kingdom and visually traverses the relationships between animals through their taxonomy.  Users can interactively explore the various connections between members of the animal kingdom via dynamic data visualization. By providing data about each creature's environment, characteristics, and endangerment status, TreeFrog aims to inspire respect for the rich variety of the natural world.

## Getting Started

The animal kingdom is categorized in a tree structure, where each "branch" contains its own subcategories; starting at the kingdom level, classification becomes more specific as we move further from the "trunk," through phylum, class, order, family, genus, and finally individual animal species.

This build of TreeFrog contains only species within the phylum *chordata*, which consists of vertebrates. To start exploring, simply click an icon in the Class column to select between birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and fish
